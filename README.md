#  ImageKit Full Stack Project (Next.js + ImageKit + NextAuth)

This project is a **full-stack web application** built using **Next.js** that integrates **ImageKit** for advanced image handling and **NextAuth** for secure authentication. The goal of this project is to understand how to build scalable, secure, and media-efficient applications using modern full-stack technologies.

> ⚡ This project was built as part of a learning course and has significantly enhanced my understanding of full-stack development, authentication, and media optimization. It has added strong value to my development profile.

##  Features

-  **Next.js App Structure :** with API routes and modern folder setup
-  **Model Design :** for handling user data and media metadata
-  **Database Integration :** (using modern ORM/tools for DB connection)
-  **NextAuth :** for authentication and session management
-  **ImageKit Integration :** for high-performance image delivery
-  **AI-Powered Image URLs** (transformation, resizing, etc.)
-  **Frontend for Register/Login**
-  **Middleware-Based Routing :** for protected pages
-  **Frontend ImageKit Integration :** for upload/view
